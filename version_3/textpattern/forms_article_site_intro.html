	<h1>Hello. Here be dragons&hellip;</h1>

	<div class="c37 c2">

		<p>It&#8217;s October 2018. I&#8217;m just in the middle of updating the design of the site so while you can read this everything is going to be a bit broken. Sorry. Shouldn&#8217;t take too long though, and all the old content will be in exactly the same places when I&#8217;m back up and running.</p>

		<p>Update: All the content is back up and looking shiny. Almost everything appears to be working after a fashion. I&rsquo;ve been documenting the redesign and development process on <a href="https://github.com/cunabula27/webdev_cunabula/">Github</a>, which has been invaluable. There are still a bunch of outstanding bits to complete but the basics are now established.</p>

		<p class="solo">Part of the <b>To Do</b> list:</p>

		<p class="solo"><b>Horizontal scrolling pages</b>. Part of the reason I set up the site in the first place was so that I had a place I could play with different presentation ideas, to see what might work (or not). And everything going up and down is a bit boring.</p>

		<p class="solo"><b>Other (and new) stuff</b>. TBD, but exciting now the heavy work is done.</p>
